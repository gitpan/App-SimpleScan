Revision history for App-SimpleScan

0.07  Tue Oct 25 14:37:00 2005
	- Changed match for accented characters to .*? instead
	  of . to make it work consistently on 5.6

	- fixed "@accents" vs. "$accent[...}" in generated code

0.05  Mon Oct 24 15:55:58 2005
	- Added a missing semicolon on the generated code for the
	  accent extraction line. 

0.04  Mon Oct 24 14:42:38 2005
	- changed 8-bit-character checks; test process seems to nuke
	  the $1, $2, etc. variables, so I can't check them back in

	  characters.
	- Systematized test counting to make sure counts were right
	- Tests now "use strict;"
	- Regex flags handled properly
	- _regex_render added to centralize regex fixups
